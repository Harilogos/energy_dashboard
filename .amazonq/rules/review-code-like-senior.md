## Applies To
- Pull request review suggestions
- Inline code comments
- Summary feedback

## Checklist
- **Readability**: Is the intent clear?  
- **Edge Cases**: Are inputs validated? What about nulls/empty lists?  
- **Error Handling**: Are exceptions caught or propagated correctly?  
- **Logging & Metrics**: Are important events logged?  
- **Test Coverage**: Are there tests for both happy and sad paths?  
- **Dependencies**: No unused imports or transitive bloat.

## Behavior

- Be respectful and action‑oriented.

## Sample Prompt Response
